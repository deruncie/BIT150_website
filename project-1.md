Project 1: In-depth study of a disease gene through an online database
===============================

The goal of this project is to explore online public databases and discover information on a gene that may be relevant
to its role in disease.

Each group will choose a disease or trait that has been linked to a specific genetic mutation (or set of mutations). 
Each student will then choose one database and find all entries in that database that reference the gene or mutation.
The following rules apply:

- Every student must choose a different database. There are 1000s of databases available. Usefull lists
can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D1/2770636/The-24th-annual-Nucleic-Acids-Research-database) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#DNA_Databases). When you choose a database, enter it in the google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpUUcnm7zhglA4vG8o2KivsalVzhVJmwRXBPyTFdBoE/edit?usp=sharing). 
Before you choose your database, ensure that someone else hasn't chosen that one first!
- The only limitation on the database is that it contains information on your groups gene or disease. Find a database
that looks interesting!

In **Project 2**, you'll collect the results from all the databases chosen by your group to come up with a hypothesis
for the disease. But here in **Project 1**, I simply want you to explore your chosen database. Prepare a Wiki page on your chosen database. Use Markdown to compose your page. You can use the [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) tool. Provide answers and links or images to address as many of the following questions as possible. We will collect these into a class Wiki site at the end.

- What type of data does the database hold? What types of biological questions could use this database to address? 
- Where does the data come from? Who collects it, currates it, and publishes it?
- How are the data stored? In what format?
- What tools are available for accessing the data?
- Are there restrictions placed on how you are allowed to use the data? What is it's license? What does this mean?
- Find a paper that cites the database. Hint: use [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). What was the study and why did they use this database?
- How many entries are there for your gene / mutation / disease?
- Describe one entry. Provide a direct link to this entry. What did you learn about your gene?
- Describe some types of biological questions that you could use this database to address.
