title: Slack Workspace for BIT150
---
[Slack](https://www.slack.com/features){:target="_blank"} is one method of staying connected that has been widely adopted by different groups within the UC Davis community. Dan and I have created a Slack workspace specifically for our use this quarter in the BIT150 class.

On the **ucdavis** Slack workspace, search for `bit150-2019`.

Some benefits for us to use slack are:

- sharing documents with one another
- group messaging
- direct messaging
- asking questions about course related content

Using slack is not a requirement, but it is a great way for connecting with one another when we are not in class.

If you have any questions about slack, please feel free to e-mail us:

* <deruncie@ucdavis.edu>
* <sgnojoomi@ucdavis.edu>

__OR__

Write the questions directly in the slack workspace once you join!

Dan and Saghi
