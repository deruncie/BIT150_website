title: Project 1 - Mining bioinformatics databases
hidden: true
---

The goal of this project is to explore online public databases.
You will use databases to mine for information on a gene of interest and its role in a disease or other trait you choose.
At the end, you should produce a report on the structure and utility of your chosen database,
and a description of the types of information it contains.

First choose a trait. Human diseases work well because there have been studied so intensely, but other characteristics of humans, animals, plants, or even bacteria can work. I recommend sticking to model systems (human, mouse, Arabidopsis) - there is much more information about these organisms in most databases.

Once you have chosen your trait, you need to find a gene that has been linked to that trait.
A useful place to start for Human traits is the [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man](https://www.omim.org) databases. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), or just [Google](https://www.google.com) also work.

Here are some trait - gene pairs as examples:

| Trait              | Gene  |
|--------------------|-------|
| Cystic Fibrosis    | CFTR  |
| Acondroplasia      | FGFR3 |
| Breast Cancer      | BRCA1 |
| Alzheimers disease | APOE  |
| Type-2 Diabetes    | INS   |
| Mad cow disease    | PRNP  |
| Sprinter gene      | ACTN3 |
| Shade-response     | PHYB  |
| Flower defects     | AP1   |

You're goal in **Projects 1 and 2** is to build a model for why mutations in this gene are associated with your trait.

For **Project 1**, as a class I want you to explore as many different databases as possible to build a catalog of types of bioinformatics information available for different classes of genes. I want each of you to choose one database and prepare a Wiki page documenting the database. 
Use Markdown to compose your page. You can use the [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) tool. The better organized and more interactive your page is, the better. You will be graded on both the content (your specific answers to the project's questions), and your presentation (quality of your page). We will collect these into a class Wiki site at the end.

In your research, aim to address as many of the following questions as you can:

- What type of data does the database hold? What types of biological questions could use this database to address?
- Where does the data come from? Who collects it, currates it, and publishes it?
- How are the data stored? In what format?
- What tools are available for accessing the data?
- Are there restrictions placed on how you are allowed to use the data? What is it's license? What does this mean?
- Find a paper that cites the database. Hint: use [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). What was the study and why did they use this database?
- How many entries are there for your gene / mutation / disease?
- Describe one entry. Provide a direct link to this entry. What did you learn about your gene?
- Describe some types of biological questions that you could use this database to address.

Here are some rules:

- You can use either a **Primary** or **Secondary** database, but limit to databases 
- Every student must choose a different database. There are 1000s of databases available. Usefull lists
can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D1/2770636/The-24th-annual-Nucleic-Acids-Research-database) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#DNA_Databases). When you choose a database, enter it in the google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpUUcnm7zhglA4vG8o2KivsalVzhVJmwRXBPyTFdBoE/edit?usp=sharing).
Before you choose your database, ensure that someone else hasn't chosen that one first!
- The only limitation on the database is that it contains information on your groups gene or disease. Find a database
that looks interesting!

For **Project 2**, you can refer back to this class resource to identify types of data that you can integrate to build a model for your gene.

**Note: If you find a databases that you want to explore that indexes something other than genes, ask**
