[TOC]

The goal of this project is to explore online public databases.
You will use databases to mine for information on a gene of interest, with the goal of generating hypotheses about its role in a disease or other trait you choose.

## Objectives
1. Choose a gene of interest 
2. Find two databases that contain information on your gene
	- One database should have "Primary" characteristics
	- One database should have "Secondary" characteristics
3. Produce a report describing and comparing the two databases and how they can be used to collect information on your gene


## Outcomes
1. Your report should be submitted as a Markdown document that can be compiled into an HTML webpage. I recommend composing the document in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/). We will compile the pages into a book for the class.
	- include a table of contents to help organization: include `[TOC]` at the top of your document. The table of contents will index all the headers in your file (lines that begin with #, ##, or ###)
	- include images if possible to make your page visually appealing.
2. Your report should have sections to describe each database succinctly, and a section comparing the databases. As a guideline, I expect ~2 pages worth of text
3. You will be graded on the content of your report as well as the quality of the presentation.

## Specific questions

- Introduce and describe the structure and utility of each database, considering the following questions:
	- What type of data does the database hold? What types of biological questions could use this database to address?
	- Does this database have primary and/or secondary characteristics? See here: [Primary and secondary databases](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/bioinformatics-terrified-2018/primary-and-secondary-databases)
	- Where does the data come from? Who collects it, currates it, and publishes it?
	- How are the data stored? In what format?
	- What tools are available for accessing the data? Can the data be accessed computationally? Can it be directly downloaded? 
	- Are there restrictions placed on how you are allowed to use the data? What is it's license? What does this mean?
	- Find a paper that cites the database. Hint: use [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). What was the study and why did they use this database?
	- How many entries are there for your gene / mutation / disease? Describe one entry. Provide a direct link to this entry. What did you learn about your gene?
- Consider each of the above database characteristics. Among the characteristics that differ between your two databases, choose the two that you think are most important and explain why.

## Rules
- Do not simply copy text from webpages - that is plagarism. Images should include a caption listing the source.  For example: 

	```
	![](https://i.imgur.com/p59kPwO.png =50x)
	
    *source: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/logos_and_images.html 
    ```

	produces an image with a width of 50 pixels:

	*source: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/about/logos_and_images.html
- Every student must choose different databases. There are 1000s of databases available. Usefull lists
can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D1/2770636/The-24th-annual-Nucleic-Acids-Research-database) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#DNA_Databases). When you choose a database, enter it in the google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xXXIRu793bdW8tQHkrdPnp79ikkt6zpC_YpE7ZqZeGg/edit?usp=sharing).
Before you choose your database, ensure that someone else hasn't chosen that one first!
- The only limitation on the database is that it contains information on your groups gene or disease. Find a database
that looks interesting!

## Hints

A useful place to start for Human traits is the [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man](https://www.omim.org) databases. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), or just [Google](https://www.google.com) also work.

Here are some trait - gene pairs as examples:

| Trait              | Gene  |
|--------------------|-------|
| Cystic Fibrosis    | CFTR  |
| Acondroplasia      | FGFR3 |
| Breast Cancer      | BRCA1 |
| Alzheimers disease | APOE  |
| Type-2 Diabetes    | INS   |
| Mad cow disease    | PRNP  |
| Sprinter gene      | ACTN3 |
| Shade-response     | PHYB  |
| Flower defects     | AP1   |

**Note: If you find a databases that you want to explore that indexes something other than genes, ask**
