title: Welcome BIT150 class of 2017!
---

Welcome to BIT150.

The first lecture will be on Thursday 9/27 at 10:00 in Wickson 1038.

Prior to class, please read the [Schatz 2015 paper](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1417.short){:target="_blank"}, and complete the BIT 150 Pre-Class Assessment - both available on the CANVAS site. The paper discusses the future of biological research over the next 20 years. Hopefully it will provide motivation for the content we'll cover this quarter. The quiz is a refresher on biological concepts that we will build on throughout the course.

We look forward to meeting you on Thursday!

Dan and Saghi
