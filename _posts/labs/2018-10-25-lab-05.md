# Goals

1. Use Cytoscape to visualize a network
2. Overlay data onto network topology
3. Analyze a network:
	-  topology
	-  GO enrichment
	

# To learn Cytoscape, start with the following two tutorials:

## Tutorial 1. Intro to Cytoscape

I've provided two tables of data on Canvas (Lab_5) and in the `Class/BIT150/Lab_5` folder.

1. `galFiltered_edge.csv` is a table of edges representing protein-protein interactions among a set of yeast proteins
2. `galExpData.csv` is a table with gene expression data on most of these proteins in a couple conditions.

First, open and inspect the two tables in `Excel` or `R`. Identify the columns and how data could be mapped between them (what keys are in common).

Then, go through the following tutorial:

[Basic Expression Analyis Tutorial](https://cytoscape.org/cytoscape-tutorials/protocols/basic-data-visualization/#/)

But make the following modifications:

1. Instead of downloading the data described on Slide #2, instead import the network from the `galFiltered_edge.csv` file using `File -> Import -> Network from File...`
2. Later in the tutorial, import the gene expression data into the `Node` table using `File -> Import -> Table from File...`. Check each of the drop-down options to see how the import is controlled.


This tutorial will teach you to import a network into Cytoscape, adjust how it is rendered, and to overlay experimental data (in this case gene expression data) onto the nodes of the network.

## Tutorial 2. Gene Ontology enrichment in Cytoscape

This tutorial will teach you to analyze a gene network for enrichments of gene ontology terms. Enrichments indicate that the set of genes in your network are non-random with respect to gene function. These "enriched" functions are good guesses for the overal importance of the network or pathway.

### Notes: 

First, install the BiNGO App in Cytoscape. `Apps -> App Manager`. Search for `BiNGO`. Click `Install`. 

Start the tutorial with a new version of the galFiltered network. Re-import it as you did in the first tutorial into a new network collection.

Go only through Step 3. You can continue Steps 4+ later if you'd like.

When you do this for your own gene, be sure to change the organism if needed.

### Gene Identifiers
The BiNGO program tries to map the node IDs to GO terms using the following identifiers:

###  Interpretation of BiNGO graph and results
 
BiNGO is aimed at providing the user with a good idea of what functional themes are present in your gene set. The p-values give a good indication about the prominence of a given functional category. However, no biologist would dream of drawing conclusions solely based on p-values, and rightly so ! The p-values returned by BiNGO can give the user additional clues, which should be interpreted in the light of other evidence.
 
The BiNGO graph visualizes the GO categories that were found significantly over-represented in the context of the GO hierarchy. The size (area) of the nodes is proportional to the number of genes in the test set which are annotated to that node. The color of the node represents the (corrected) p-value. White nodes are not significantly over-represented, the other ones are, with a color scale ranging from yellow (p-value = significance level, e.g. 0.01) to dark orange (p-value = 5 orders of magnitude smaller than significance level, e.g. 10-5 * 0.01). The color saturates at dark orange for p-values which are more than 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the chosen significance level. 

Due to the interdependency of functional categories in the GO hierarchy, it is very likely that not one category, but a whole branch of the GO hierarchy lights up as being significantly over-represented. In such cases, interpretation can be more difficult. The darkest orange nodes which are furthest down the hierarchy are probably the ones that you're looking for. Suppose for example that a branch of metabolism categories lights up (see figure).

## Notes:

- To color the genes with a particular GO category, use the BiNGO output table to **Select nodes**. Then, in the gene network view, select the Style table, and click the **third box** in the style row you want to use (ex. **Fill Color**), and select a style. This box allows you to **Bypass** the normal attribute scheme just for the selected nodes.
- To get a table of the BiNGO results, in the BiNGO window, click the box **Check Box for saving Data**. This saves a `.bgo` file. This file can be opened in a text editor. You can copy the table from this file and paste it into Excel. From excel, you can then subset the columns you want.
- To use a table in Markdown, use this website: [Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). It lets you paste in table data copied from Excel, and formats the table for Markdown.

## Other networks

There are other ways to import networks into Cytoscape.

1. Download a edge file from a PPIN database like String or PSICQUIC.
2. `File -> Import -> Public Databases...`. 
    - `Universal Interaction Database Client. This is PSICQuIC
    - `WikiPathways` a collection of community annotated networks and pathways.
3. Get the KEGGParser app from the app store. `Apps -> KEGGParser -> Load KGML -> KEGG web load task`. You need to know the KEGG pathway ID first. Then you enter it here and it will download the network.

You can use any of these networks for any of the tasks we described here. 


# Assignment

1. Create a network model for your gene for Project 2.  If you haven't picked yet, do so soon! But you can use any gene you'd like that we haven't work with in class.
	- Options: String netowrk, PSICQUIC network (can access from inside Cytoscape), WikiPathways network (can access from inside Cytoscape), or KEGG pathway (requires KEGGParser app inside Cytoscape)
	- Import Network into Cytoscape
	- Create a network view that shows the features of the network	- Identify over-represented gene functions within the network
2. Create a Markdown document including:
   - an image of the network
   - A table of enriched GO terms
   - A description of what you can learn from the network
