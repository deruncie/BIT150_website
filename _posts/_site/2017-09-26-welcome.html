<p>Welcome to BIT150.</p>

<p>The first lecture will be on Thursday 9/28 at 10:00 in Hoagland 113.</p>

<p>Prior to class, please read the <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1417.short" target="_blank">Schatz 2015 paper</a>, and complete the BIT 150 Pre-Class Assessment - both available on the CANVAS site. The paper discusses the future of biological research over the next 20 years. Hopefully it will provide motivation for the content weâ€™ll cover this quarter. The quiz is a refresher on biological concepts that we will build on throughout the course.</p>

<p>We look forward to meeting you on Thursday!</p>

<p>Dan and Shawn</p>
