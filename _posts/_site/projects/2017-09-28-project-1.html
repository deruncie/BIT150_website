<p>The goal of this project is to explore online public databases and discover information on a gene that may be relevant to its role in diseases or other traits.</p>

<p>First choose a trait. Human diseases work well because there have been study so intensely, but other characteristics of humans, animals, plants, or even bacteria can work. I recommend sticking to model systems (human, mouse, Arabidopsis) - there is much more information about these organisms in most databases.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your trait, you need to find a gene that has been linked to that trait.
A useful place to start for Human traits is the <a href="www.omim.org">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</a> databases. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, or just <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> also work.</p>

<p>Here are some trait - gene pairs as examples:</p>

<!--table-->
<p>| Trait              | Gene  |
|——————–|——-|
| Cystic Fibrosis    | CFTR  |
| Acondroplasia      | FGFR3 |
| Breast Cancer      | BRCA1 |
| Alzheimers disease | APOE  |
| Type-2 Diabetes    | INS   |
| Sprinter gene      | ACTN3 |
| Shade-response     | PHYB  |
| Flower defects     | AP1   |
<!--endtable--></p>

<p>You’re goal in <strong>Projects 1 and 2</strong> is to build a model for why mutations in this gene are associated with your trait.</p>

<p>For <strong>Project 1</strong>, as a class I want you to explore as many different databases as possible to build a catalog of types of bioinformatics information available for different classes of genes. I want each of you to choose one database and prepare a Wiki page documenting the database. Use Markdown to compose your page. You can use the <a href="https://hackmd.io/">HackMD</a> tool. Provide answers and links or images to address as many of the following questions as possible. Organize the information in a readable way. We will collect these into a class Wiki site at the end.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What type of data does the database hold? What types of biological questions could use this database to address?</li>
  <li>Where does the data come from? Who collects it, currates it, and publishes it?</li>
  <li>How are the data stored? In what format?</li>
  <li>What tools are available for accessing the data?</li>
  <li>Are there restrictions placed on how you are allowed to use the data? What is it’s license? What does this mean?</li>
  <li>Find a paper that cites the database. Hint: use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google scholar</a>. What was the study and why did they use this database?</li>
  <li>How many entries are there for your gene / mutation / disease?</li>
  <li>Describe one entry. Provide a direct link to this entry. What did you learn about your gene?</li>
  <li>Describe some types of biological questions that you could use this database to address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every student must choose a different database. There are 1000s of databases available. Usefull lists
can be found <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D1/2770636/The-24th-annual-Nucleic-Acids-Research-database">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biological_databases#DNA_Databases">here</a>. When you choose a database, enter it in the google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpUUcnm7zhglA4vG8o2KivsalVzhVJmwRXBPyTFdBoE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. 
Before you choose your database, ensure that someone else hasn’t chosen that one first!</li>
  <li>The only limitation on the database is that it contains information on your groups gene or disease. Find a database
that looks interesting!</li>
</ul>

<p>For <strong>Project 2</strong>, you can refer back to this class resource to identify types of data that you can integrate to build a model for your gene.</p>

<p><strong>Note: If you find a databases that you want to explore that indexes something other than genes, ask</strong></p>
