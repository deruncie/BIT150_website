## Rationale:  
Bioinformatics is the use of computational tools to collect, annotate, and analyze biological data. Bioinformatics tools are critical for many areas of modern biological research, both for the processing of modern high-throughput data, and for linking new data to existing data and biological knowledge. This course provides an introduction to the field of Bioinformatics from the perspective of a Bioinformatics user - one who uses Bioinformatics tools to address biological questions.

 

## Course Aims and Outcomes:  

### Aims

This course aims to introduce students to the major types of bioinformatics tools - databases, computer programs, and workflows - used in bioinformatics research today. Students will gain familiarity with how data are collected, archived, retrieved, and analyzed, and how different types of data can be integrated to lead to new biological knowledge.

 
### Specific Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this course, students will:

- Learn about types of biological data, where and how they are stored in databases, and how they can be retrieved.
- Appreciate the role of computation in (hypothesis-driven) discovery processes within the life sciences.
- Design Unix and R pipelines to link bioinformatics tools for automatic processing and to document analyses
- Search databases using online and terminal-based tools for data relevant to biological questions
- Troubleshoot bioinformatics analyses using product manuals and online resources.
- Work collaboratively in groups to solve complex problems that require bioinformatics tools and to communicate results
- Understand how data on genome architecture is stored and searched
- Understand how data on molecular structures is stored and searched
- Understand how data on molecular activities is stored and searched
- Understand how data on genetic variation is stored and searched



### Format and Procedures:  

The class is split between two 50-minute lectures and one 2hr lab per week. Lectures will be structured around conceptual concepts of bioinformatics, and will include group discussions related to readings given beforehand. Labs will include practical demonstrations of computational concepts, and time for group work on projects.

#### My expectations

- Come to lectures and participate in group discussions and activities
- Come to lab to work through lab materials, and use remaining time for individual / group projects. This is the best time to receive help from me and the TA
- Choose projects that you find interesting
- Help others when they are struggling. Each tool and program is different and sometimes it takes multiple sets of eyes to find the key link or error in a program

 

#### Class attendance and participation policy:  
Attendance at both lectures and labs is required, and participation in discussions and group projects will contribute to the final grade.

#### Course readings:  
There is no required text. Specific readings will be assigned based on available sources.

#### Grading Procedures:

|                       |  |
|----------------------------|-----|
| Attendance / participation | 10% |
| Homework / Quizzes         | 10% |
| Lab Reports                | 20% |
| Project 1                  | 10% |
| Project 2                  | 25% |
| Project 3                  | 25% |

Homeworks will be assigned periodically after lab periods and will be due the following week. Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas based on readings and will be due before lecture. Projects will involve both a written report and presentation. Attendance and participation involves active involvement in group discussions and projects.

 

## Academic Integrity
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.  Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. [Optional: For this course, collaboration is allowed in the following instances: list instances.]

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

 

## Accommodations for students with disabilities

In compliance with the UC Davis policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made. Students are encouraged to register with UC Davis Student Disability Center to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.


##  Inclusivity Statement

We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. UC Davis is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community we ask all members to:

- share their unique experiences, values and beliefs
- be open to the views of others
- honor the uniqueness of their colleagues
- appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community
- value each otherâ€™s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature
- use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course and across the Davis community
