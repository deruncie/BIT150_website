# Discussion Topic 2:

> __Question 2:__ What types of biological data are collected?

> __Question 3:__ How do you go from DNA to an organism (person, plant, animal, bacterium, protist)?

> __Question 4:__ What if you go in the other direction? What is below DNA?

> __Question 5:__ What are the data associated with each?

> __Question 6:__ What types of data do you know about each?

## __Group Discussion Response Items__

- DNA Gene mRNA Protein
- Cells
- Tissues
- Organs
- mRNA and protein expression levels: quantification of active molecules
- Sequence mutations
- Splicing
- Transcript
- Modifications
- Metabolites within a cell
- Domains
- Promoters
- Specific DNA sequences that effect the phenotype of the organism (enhancers)
- For every genome, attempt to predict what the phenotype will be

> For other types of data, how do proteins interact with each other?

## Types of data on organisms

 - Popgen
 - Microbiome
 - Measuring epigenetic factors
 - Diseases, species abundance

## Take home message:

> A good question to ask when starting a bioinformatics project is: __What is the scale of the system for each variable type?__

## For the first project:

> Find a biological database related to a disease or trait of your choice, a gene associated with the disease, and research it. Reporting on your findings will serve as the first project.
